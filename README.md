# Assignment A01 

The purpose of this assignment is to become familiar with GitHub and working with repos within it. 

This project used the California Housing dataset within the sklearn.datasets package in Python. 

In order to run this script, you must do the following: 

1. Clone the Respository in GitHub Desktop.
2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code and make sure Python 3.12 (or similar) is set as the virtual environment.
3. Install the required packages by doing: python install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the boxplot.py script by doing: python scr/boxplot.py

After doing this, you should see an image in the repository's figs folder. This figure should be a single boxplot of the median home value for the California Housing dataset.
